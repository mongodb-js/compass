## Usage

### Scripts

`link-plugin`: Links the Compass plugin and Compass for development along with React to ensure the
  plugin and Compass are using the same React instance.

```shell
COMPASS_HOME=/path/to/my/compass npm run link-plugin
```

`unlink-plugin`: Restores Compass and the plugin to their original unlinked state.

```shell
COMPASS_HOME=/path/to/my/compass npm run unlink-plugin
```

## Features

#### Storybook

Develop and prototype your component with [react-storybook][react-storybook] in a standalone
browser view, with linked stories and hot reloading.

To run storybook mode, type `npm run storybook`, then open
[http://localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001) in a browser. You can now edit the source code
and hit _save_, and changes will immediately show in the browser, while maintaining the state
of the component(s).

#### Electron

Validate and test your component in an Electron window, styles included. The source automatically
compiles and the window content reloads when any file under `./src` changes.

To start Electron and render your component, type `npm start`.

If you edit the source code and hit _save_, the source will rebuild and the window reload
automatically. State is not maintained throughout reloads (to maintain application state,
use _storybook_ instead).

#### Enzyme

The test environment is configured to test components with [Enzyme][enzyme]
(including full `mount` mode through [jsdom][jsdom]) and [enzyme-chai][enzyme-chai].
See the test folder for examples. Run `npm test` to execute the test suite.

## Developing

Almost all of your development will happen in the `./src` directory. Add new components
to `./src/components`, actions to `./src/actions/index.js` and if you need additional
stores, add them to `./src/stores`.

#### Directory Structure

For completeness, below is a list of directories present in this module:

- `.storybook` react-storybook and webpack configuration. You usually don't need to touch this.
- `electron` code to start electron, open a browser window and load the source.
  You don't usually need to touch this, unless you want to render something other
  than the main component in Electron.
- `lib` compiled version of your components (plain javascript instead of `jsx`) and
  styles (`css` instead of `less`). Never change anything here as this entire folder
  gets automatically created and overwritten.
- `src` components, actions and stores source code, as well as style files. This is the
  place to implement your own components. `npm run compile` will use `./src` as input
  and create `./lib`.
- `stories` stories for react-storybook. You can add as many story files as you like,
  they are automatically added to storybook.
- `test` implement your tests here, and name the files `*.test.js`.
