# compass-schema

> Compass Schema Tab Plugin

## Usage

### Scripts

`link-plugin`: Links the Compass plugin and Compass for development along with React to ensure the
  plugin and Compass are using the same React instance.

```shell
COMPASS_HOME=/path/to/my/compass npm run link-plugin
```

`unlink-plugin`: Restores Compass and the plugin to their original unlinked state.

```shell
COMPASS_HOME=/path/to/my/compass npm run unlink-plugin
```

#### Electron

Validate and test your component in an Electron window, styles included. The source automatically
compiles and the window content reloads when any file under `./src` changes.

To start Electron and render your component, type `npm start`.
#### Enzyme

The test environment is configured to test components with [Enzyme][enzyme]
(including full `mount` mode through [jsdom][jsdom]) and [enzyme-chai][enzyme-chai].
See the test folder for examples. Run `npm test` to execute the test suite.

## Developing

Almost all of your development will happen in the `./src` directory. Add new components
to `./src/components`, actions to `./src/actions/index.js` and if you need additional
stores, add them to `./src/stores`.

To be able to debug the plugin inside `compass` make sure [webpack prod
config](./config/webpack.prod.config.js) has `devtool` is set to `source-map`.
If you want faster compiler time when you commit/push, switch it to `false.`

```js
const config = {
  target: 'electron-renderer',
  devtool: 'source-map'
}
```

#### Directory Structure

For completeness, below is a list of directories present in this module:

- `electron` code to start electron, open a browser window and load the source.
  You don't usually need to touch this, unless you want to render something other
  than the main component in Electron.
- `lib` compiled version of your components (plain javascript instead of `jsx`) and
  styles (`css` instead of `less`). Never change anything here as this entire folder
  gets automatically created and overwritten.
- `src` components, actions and stores source code, as well as style files. This is the
  place to implement your own components. `npm run compile` will use `./src` as input
  and create `./lib`.
- `test` implement your tests here, and name the files `*.test.js`.
