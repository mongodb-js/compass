## reflux-state-mixin

A mixin to make Reflux Stores to have a state, similar to React components.

### Installation

```bash
$ npm install @mongodb-js/reflux-state-mixin --save
```

### in store:

```javascript
// myStore.js
var Reflux = require('reflux');
var StateMixin = require('reflux-state-mixin');
var Actions = require('./../actions/AnimalsActions');

var AnimalStore = (module.exports = Reflux.createStore({
  mixins: [StateMixin.store],
  listenables: Actions, //or any other way of listening...

  getInitialState: function () {
    //that's a must!
    return {
      dogs: 5,
      cats: 3,
    };
  },

  onNewDogBorn: function () {
    this.setState({ dogs: this.state.dogs + 1 });
    //just like in a Component.
    //this will `trigger()` this state, similar to `render()` in a Component
  },

  //you can use storeDidUpdate lifecycle in the store, which will get called with every change to the state
  storeDidUpdate: function (prevState) {
    if (this.state.dogs !== prevState.dogs) {
      console.log('number of dogs has changed!');
    }
  },
}));
```

### in component:

#### 1. the easy way - connect, with mixin or decorator:

```javascript
// PetsComponent.js
var AnimalStore = require('./AnimalStore.js');
var StateMixin = require('reflux-state-mixin');

var PetsComponent = React.createClass({
    mixins:[
        StateMixin.connect(AnimalStore, 'dogs')
        StateMixin.connect(AnimalStore, 'cats')
        //OR
        StateMixin.connect(AnimalStore) //now PetsComponent.state includes AnimalStore.state
        ],

    render: function () {
        return (<div><p>We have {this.state.dogs + this.state.cats} pets</p></div>);
    }
})

```

and if you use React's es6 classes, use the es7 `connector` decorator:

```javascript
import { connector } from 'reflux-state-mixin';
import { AnimalStore } from './AnimalStore';

//@viewPortDecorator // make sure other decorators that returns a Component (usually those who provide props) are above `connector` (since it controls state).
@connector(AnimalStore, 'cats')
@connector(AnimalStore, 'dogs')
//or the entire store
@connector(AnimalStore)
//@autobind //other decorators could be anywhere
class PetsComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    let { dogs, cats } = this.state;
    return <div>We have {dogs + cats} pets</div>;
  }
}
```

#### or if you want to take the long way:

##### listening to a specific property of Store's state

```javascript
var AnimalStore = require('./AnimalStore.js');

var DogsComponent = React.createClass({
  mixins: [Reflux.ListenerMixin],
  getInitialState: function () {
    return {
      dogs: AnimalStore.state.dogs,
      //Treat store.state as immutable data - same as you treat component.state -
      //you could use it inside a component, but never change it's value - only with setState()
    };
  },
  componentDidMount: function () {
    this.listenTo(AnimalStore.dogs, this.updateDogs);
    //this Component has no interest in `cats` or any other animal, so it listens to `dogs` changes only
  },
  updateDogs: function (dogs) {
    this.setState({ dogs: dogs });
    //now we have auto-synchronization with `dogs`, with no need for specific logic for that
  },
  render: function () {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>We have {this.state.dogs} dogs</p>
      </div>
    );
  },
});
```

##### listen to an entire store:

```javascript
var AnimalStore = require('./AnimalStore.js');

var PetsComponent = React.createClass({
  mixins: [Reflux.ListenerMixin],
  getInitialState: function () {
    return {
      dogs: AnimalStore.state.dogs,
      cats: AnimalStore.state.cats,
    };
  },
  componentDidMount: function () {
    this.listenTo(AnimalStore, (state) => {
      this.setState({
        dogs: state.dogs,
        cats: state.cats,
      });
    });
    //this way the component can easily decide what parts of the store-state are interesting
  },

  render: function () {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>We have {this.state.dogs + this.state.cats} pets</p>
      </div>
    );
  },
});
```

## some details

`GetInitialState()` in store should have all of the states from the beginning.
Store should not have any method that are declared in state, since you can listen to MyStore.dogs
`setState()` is checking to see if there is a difference between new `state.key` from current `state.key`. If not, this specific `state.key` it's not triggering.
For any `setState()` the entire store is triggering (regardless of changes), allowing any Component or other Store to listen to the entire Store's state.
