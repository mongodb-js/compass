   * AppRegistry (both ConnectionScopedAppRegistry and GlobalAppRegistry) to
   * communicate between plugins in Compass which is why the usage of this
   * method should be as sparse as possible. So far we expect only the global
   * modals to still be relying on ConnectionScopedAppRegistry.emit but other
   * than those places, usage of this method in any other place is not
   * recommended. Read compass-field-store plugin and compass-workspaces plugin
   * to understand how other plugins communicate with these plugins without
   * relying on AppRegistry events.
