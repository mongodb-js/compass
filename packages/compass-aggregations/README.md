> Compass Plugin for the MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Builder.

[![](https://docs.mongodb.com/compass/master/_images/agg-builder-export-dropdown.png)](https://docs.mongodb.com/compass/master/aggregation-pipeline-builder/)

## Code Tour

- `src/components/aggregations` The primary export is connected component
- `src/modules/` is where action happens
    - action creators components call
    - reducers that call dataService, window.open, emit to other plugins, etc.
    - follows the `ducks` pattern
- `src/stores/store` is where plugin listens+responds to events of interest from other plugins
- store is global state instantiated via `configureStore()`
- All tests are local to their module e.g. `src/*/<module>.spec.js`

### Note: Cross-plugin Communication

> How does clicking on export to language button in aggregation builder show the modal that has code in it?

The aggregation builder in Compass actually involves 2 Compass plugins:

- [`<Aggregation />`](https://github.com/mongodb-js/compass-aggregations) Plugin for primary UI
- [`<ExportToLanguage />`](https://github.com/mongodb-js/compass-export-to-language) Modal plugin that connects `<Aggregation />` to `bson-transpilers` [for actual compiling to another language](https://github.com/mongodb-js/bson-transpilers)

Here's how these 2 plugins come together:

- `./src/modules/export-to-language.js` `appRegistry.emit('open-aggregation-export-to-language', generatePipelineAsString())`
- [`compass-export-to-language/src/stores/store.js`](https://github.com/mongodb-js/compass-export-to-language/blob/master/src/stores/store.js#L16) Listener for 'export to lang' event via appRegistry and renders its modal.
- [`compass-export-to-language/src/modules/export-query.js`](https://github.com/mongodb-js/compass-export-to-language/blob/master/src/modules/export-query.js#L56) has reducer for calling `bson-transpilers.compile()` which populates the code in the modal dialog.

### Usage with a `mongodb-data-service` Provider

See `./examples-data-service-provider.js` for details on what `data-service` functions are used and the applicable options for each.

## Examples

These are a base set of example aggregation's from @terakilobyte used in his M121 agg framework university course. These provide canonical, real-world references of various complexity for us to design/test against. The underlying source datasets are in Atlas and connected to a Stitch app (see [`examples/data-service-provider.js`](https://github.com/mongodb-js/compass-aggregations/blob/master/examples/data-service-provider.js)).

### Basic

[`example-basic.js`](https://github.com/mongodb-js/compass-aggregations/blob/master/examples/example-basic.js) is a simple `$match` and `$count`.

### Array Stats

[`example-array-stats.js`](https://github.com/mongodb-js/compass-aggregations/blob/master/examples/example-array-stats.js) uses `$project` of accumulators to generate summary statistics

### Grouped Stats

[`example-grouped-stats.js`](https://github.com/mongodb-js/compass-aggregations/blob/master/examples/example-grouped-stats.js) uses `$match` and `$group` to achieve the same goal as `example-array-stats.js`

[View in storybook](https://mongodb-js.github.io/compass-aggregations/?path=/story/examples--grouped-stats)

### Schema Checker

[`example-complex.js`](https://github.com/mongodb-js/compass-aggregations/blob/master/examples/example-schema-checker.js) uses `$lookup` and more to sanity check mistyped names or bad references.

### Pearson's rho

[`example-pearsons-rho.js`](https://github.com/mongodb-js/compass-aggregations/blob/master/examples/example-pearsons-rho.js) calculates [the correlation co-efficient of two fields using Pearsons Rho](http://ilearnasigoalong.blogspot.com/2017/10/calculating-correlation-inside-mongodb.html). (HT @johnlpage)

### Registering Examples

See [`aggregations.stories.js`](https://github.com/mongodb-js/compass-aggregations/blob/master/examples/aggregations.stories.js).

### Adding new examples

1. [Put your data set in MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com/)
2. Create a new Stitch app with read permissions for the example collection
3. Copy `./example-grouped-stats.js` to `./example-<my-example>.js` and update with your pipeline details and `stitchAppId`
4. In [`aggregations.stories.js`](https://github.com/mongodb-js/compass-aggregations/blob/master/examples/aggregations.stories.js) `import MY_EXAMPLE from ./example-<my-example>.js` and add a new story
5. `npm run storybook` and your new example will load
6. Open a new pull request with your changes and include a brief description of what you use this aggregation pipeline for.


## Contributing

## Usage

This plugin uses an instance of a Redux store and not the traditional singleton,
so the store instance must be passed to the plugin. The plugin exports a function
to initialise the store instance, which decorates it with various methods to
conveniently set any values it uses.

This is for:
  - `@mongodb-js/compass-aggregations 4.0.0-beta.11`
  - `@mongodb-js/compass-export-to-language 4.0.2`

### Browser

Setting values via configure:

```js
import AppRegistry from 'hadron-app-registry';
import AggregationsPlugin, {
  configureStore as configureAggregationsStore
} from '@mongodb-js/compass-aggregations';
import ExportToLanguagePlugin, {
  configureStore as configureExportToLanguageStore
} from '@mongodb-js/compass-export-to-language';

const handleOut = (namespace) => {
  window.open(`https://cloud.mongodb.com/${namespace}`, '_new');
};

const handleCopy = (query) => {
  alert(query);
};

const appRegistry = new AppRegistry();

const aggregationsStore = configureAggregationsStore({
  dataProvider: {
    error: null,
    dataProvider: dataProvider
  },
  namespace: 'db.coll',
  serverVersion: '4.2.0',
  fields: [],
  isAtlasDeployed: true,
  allowWrites: false,
  outResultsFn: handleOut,
  env: 'atlas',
  localAppRegistry: appRegistry
});

const exportToLanguageStore = configureExportToLanguageStore({
  localAppRegistry: appRegistry,
  copyToClipboardFn: handleCopy
});

<AggregationsPlugin store={aggregationsStore} />
<ExportToLanguagePlugin store={exportToLanguageStore} />
```

### Hadron/Electron

```js
const role = appRegistry.getRole('Collection.Tab')[0];
const Plugin = role.component;
const configureStore = role.configureStore;
const store = configureStore({
  globalAppRegistry: appRegistry,
  localAppRegistry: localAppRegistry,
  dataProvider: {
    error: null,
    dataProvider: dataProvider
  },
  env: 'on-prem',
  namespace: 'db.coll',
  serverVersion: '4.2.0',
  fields: []
});

<Plugin store={store} />
```

### Fields

The fields array must be an array of objects that the ACE editor autocompleter understands. See
[This example](https://github.com/mongodb-js/ace-autocompleter/blob/master/lib/constants/accumulators.js)
for what that array looks like.

### Data Provider

The data provider is an object that must adhere to the following interface:

```js
/**
 * Get a count of documents.
 *
 * @param {String} namespace - The namespace in "db.collection" format.
 * @param {Object} filter - The MQL query filter.
 * @param {Object} options - The query options.
 * @param {Function} callback - Gets error and integer count as params.
 */
provider.count(namespace, filter, options, callback);

/**
 * Execute an aggregation pipeline.
 *
 * @param {String} namespace - The namespace in "db.collection" format.
 * @param {Array} pipeline - The pipeline.
 * @param {Object} options - The agg options.
 * @param {Function} callback - Gets error and cursor as params. Cursor must
 *   implement #toArray (which takes a callback with error and an array of result docs)
 *   and #close
 */
provider.aggregate(namespace, pipeline, options, callback);
```

### App Registry Events Emmitted
Various actions within this plugin will emit events for other parts of the
application can be listened to via [hadron-app-registry][hadron-app-registry].
`Local` events are scoped to a `Tab`.
`Global` events are scoped to the whole Compass application.
