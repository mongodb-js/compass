## Features

#### Electron

Validate and test your component in an Electron window, styles included. The source automatically compiles and the window content reloads when any file under `./src` changes.

To start Electron and render your component, type `npm start`.

#### Enzyme

The test environment is configured to test components with [Enzyme][enzyme] (including full `mount` mode through [jsdom][jsdom]) and [enzyme-chai][enzyme-chai]. See the test folder for examples. Run `npm test` to execute the test suite.

## Developing

Almost all of your development will happen in the `./src` directory. Add new components
to `./src/components`, actions to `./src/actions/index.js` and if you need additional stores, add them to `./src/stores`.

#### Directory Structure

For completeness, below is a list of directories present in this module:

- `electron` code to start electron, open a browser window and load the source. You don't usually need to touch this, unless you want to render something other than the main component in Electron.
- `lib` compiled version of your components (plain javascript instead of `jsx`) and styles (`css` instead of `less`). Never change anything here as this entire folder gets automatically created and overwritten.
- `src` components, actions and stores source code, as well as style files. This is the place to implement your own components. `npm run compile` will use `./src` as input and create `./lib`.
- `test` implement your tests here, and name the files `*.test.js`.
