# compass-schema-validation

> Compass plugin for Schema Validation

Compass Schema Validation supports complex validation rules based on JSON Schema, along with the already supported MQL-based simple validation. Compared with previously available document validation, JSON Schema is much more flexible when creating complex validation rules.

## Features

- Showing, creating, editing and deleting schema validation rules.
- Using both MQL and JSON schema syntax.
- Accepting any query syntax including $jsonSchema but not be limited to it.
- Autocompleting fields and keywords.
- Syntactic validation to enforce correct syntax.
- Showing and modifying validationLevel (strict, moderate, off).
- Showing and modifying validationAction (error, warn).
- Showing preview of sample documents in the collection that match and do not match the validation rules.
