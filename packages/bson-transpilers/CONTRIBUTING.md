# Contributing to bson-transpilers

## Setting up your environment
The `bson-transpilers` package uses
[ANTLR4](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/javascript-target.md)
to create a parse tree. As `ANTLR` is written in Java, you will need to set up a
few tools before being able to compile this locally. 

Make sure you have Java installed:
```shell
$ brew cask install java
```

Download `ANTLR4`:
```shell
$ cd /usr/local/lib && curl -O http://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar
```

You will then need to add it to your `$CLASSPATH`:
```shell
$ export CLASSPATH=".:/usr/local/lib/antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar:$CLASSPATH"
```

Alias `antlr4` and `grun`:
```shell
$ alias antlr4='java -Xmx500M -cp "/usr/local/lib/antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar:$CLASSPATH" org.antlr.v4.Tool' && alias grun='java org.antlr.v4.gui.TestRig'
```

_I strongly suggest using an IDE that will help you visualize ANTLR trees (JetBrains has a good plugin).
 Otherwise you can use the java version of the grammar and compile it with 
 `javac <Language>*.java && grun <Language> <StartRule> -gui`. 
 [This might be helpful](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/getting-started.md)._

Then compile and run tests locally with:
```shell
$ npm run compile && npm run test
```

You can provide a few environmental variables to help you test your specific
output and input languages. If none are provided, everything will run.
- __INPUT=:__ comma-separated input languages you want to test
- __OUTPUT=:__ comma-separated output languages you want to test. Also called "target" language.
- __MODE=:__ comma-separated names of the test files (without .yaml) that you want to run 

```shell
OUTPUT=csharp INPUT=shell MODE=native,bson npm run test 
```

# How it works
## Compilation Stages
Similar to how many transpilers work, this package parses the input 
string into a tree and then generates code from the tree using the [Visitor 
pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern).

### Step 1: Parsing
Parsing and tree generation is handled by ANTLR4. 
The grammar files are located in the `grammars` folder, and the javascript 
parser/lexer/etc. generated from the grammar are located in `lib/antlr`. To make
changes to the grammar, you have to modify the `.g4` file in `grammars`, then 
run `npm run compile`. You should never directly modify files in `lib`.

Each grammar will generate a tree that is unique to the grammar. This means that
for equivalent input code, the tree generated from ECMAScript.g4 is not going to be
exactly the same as the tree generated by Python3.g4. As a result, we need different
visitor classes for each tree.

ANTLR generates a "shell" visitor class for each tree in 
`lib/antlr/<grammar name>Visitor.js`. It contains an empty method
for each node in the parse tree.


### Step 2: Visitor
<img alt="visiting-tree" width="60%" align="right" src="/img-docs/visiting-tree.png"/>

Because the project is designed to handle multiple input languages and multiple 
output languages, the tree visitation stage is split into parts. The first part
is handled in the visitor class defined in `codegeneration/<input language>/Visitor.js`.
It is a (sub)subclass of the "empty" visitor class generated in `lib/antlr`.

This visitor class <b>is specific to the input language</b> and can only visit 
a tree generated by that grammar. The visitor visits each node and use a 
[string template](#templates) defined in either the [symbol table](#symbols) 
or the [type table](#types) to generate code in the ouput language. 
For expressions that are too complex for a string template, the visitor will call an 
`emit` method defined in the [Generator](#step-3:-generator). The general rule is 
that emit methods aren't required unless you're doing something very unusual! Or
if you need to do any tree manipulation, since the templates only have access to the
arguments that are sent to them (usually function name and args).

If the node requires special treatment for all output languages, the visitor will 
define a `process<type>` method that will do some pre-processing before calling 
the appropriate string template or `emit` method. An example is `processDate` in 
the JS visitor, which constructs a date object from the input and passes it to the 
Date template.

There is a lot of repeated code between input-language-specific visitors, so a lot of that has been moved into
`codegeneration/CodeGenerationVisitor.js`. Each input-language-specific visitor will define `get` methods
that provide a layer of indirection around the tree so that the generic visitor or any generators do not need to know or
care about what tree it's visiting. The CodeGenerationVisitor also includes
helper methods that every input language may use.


### Step 3: Generator
The other half of the tree visitation stage. Each ouput language will 
have a Generator class defined in `codegeneration/<ouput language>/Generator.js`. 
The Generator class generates code, so it is <b> specific to the ouput language.
</b> The Generator class is a subclass of the input language's visitor class. 
So for example, translating between JS and Python, the order of inheritance will be:
   1. `lib/antlr/ECMAScriptVisitor.js` ["empty" superclass, specific to the tree built by ANTLR]
   2. `codegeneration/CodeGenerationVisitor.js` ["generic" visitor, shared between all languages]
   3. `codegeneration/javascript/Visitor.js` [specific to input language]
   4. `codegeneration/python/Generator.js` [specific to output language]

For nodes that cannot be translated using 
templates, the Generator class will define a method called `emit<type>` which
takes in a tree node, some optional metadata, and returns the transformed string.
Modifying output in the Generator should only be done if it's not possible to
modify it using a string template.

## Handling Identifiers

When the visitor in [step #1](#step-1:-parsing) reaches a function call, variable, attribute access, or other "identifier" 
expression it needs a way of knowing what that symbol evaluates to in order to know if it is valid.

### Symbols
Each input language has it's own set of symbols that are part of the 
language. The majority of symbols supported in the input languages are BSON types 
(i.e. `Int32`, `ObjectId`, etc) but there are a few native types like `RegExp` and 
`Date` that are not BSON-specific. In order for the transpiler to know if a symbol 
is undefined, we store symbol information in a 
[Symbol Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol_table).

#### Symbol Metadata
The visitor uses the symbol table to determine if a symbol is undefined, but the 
symbol table also stores some metadata so the visitor can do type and other validity checks. The symbols
are defined in [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) in the 
`symbols/<input language>/symbols.yaml` file. A symbol definition looks like:


```yml
    Decimal128:
        id: "Decimal128"
        callable: *constructor
        args:
            - [ *ObjectType ]
        type: *Decimal128Type
        attr:
            fromString:
                id: "fromString"
                callable: *func
                args:
                    - [ *StringType ]
                type: *Decimal128Type
                attr: {}
                template: *Decimal128SymbolFromStringTemplate
                argsTemplate: *Decimal128SymbolFromStringArgsTemplate
        template: *Decimal128SymbolTemplate
        argsTemplate: *Decimal128SymbolArgsTemplate
```
<br>

| Field     | Data         |
| ----------|:-------------|
| id        | The name of the attribute. Mostly used for error reporting and the `emit` or `process` method names. |
| callable  | Used for determining if the symbol can be part of a function call. There are three types of symbols: <br><br>`*func`: a function call. If the symbol is found as the "left-hand-side" of a function call, it is valid. <br><br>`*constructor`: also a function call, but may require a `new` keyword if the output language requires it. <br><br>`*var`: a variable. Indicates to the transpiler that the symbol cannot be invoked, i.e. `<symbol>()`  is invalid.|
| args      | Used for type checking. If the symbol is callable, i.e. a `*func` or `*constructor`, then the expected arguments are defined here as an array. So for example, if the function takes in a string as the first arg, and an optional second arg that can be a object or array, args will look like <br>`[ [*StringType], [*ObjectType, *ArrayType, null] ]`. Null indicates optional.|
| type      | The type that the symbol evaluates to. If it is a variable, it will be the type of the variable. If it is a function, it will be the return type. See the [Types](#types) section.|
| attr      | Used for determining if attribute access is valid. This field is also a symbol table, but a namespace-prefixed one. So for the example above, `Decimal128.fromString` is a valid attribute, so we need to define the symbol `fromString` in the same way we defined the `Decimal128` symbol.|
| template  | Used for code generation. See the [Templates](#templates) section.|
| argsTemplate | Used for code generation. See the [Templates](#templates) section.|


### Types
Each input language also has a set of types that are part of the language. 
The set of types that are universal for all languages (i.e. "primitives", 
"literals", like `string`, `integer`, etc) are defined in the file 
`symbols/basic_types.yaml`.

Types that are specific to the input language are defined in `symbols/<input 
language>/types.yaml`. These include BSON types, i.e. classes like `ObjectId`, and
language-specific types like `RegExp` and `Date`. The types are defined in the same
pattern as the symbols and contain the same metadata as the symbols.

NOTE: It is important not to mix up symbols and types, especially since they can share 
the same identifier and are basically the same thing but we have to make a distinction somewhere 
because otherwise we will end up with invalid code.
The **symbol** `ObjectId` has attributes like `ObjectId.fromString(...)` 
and is a constructor, so `ObjectId()` is valid. The **type** `ObjectId` has 
attributes like `ObjectId().toString()` and is *a variable*, so `ObjectId()()` 
is not valid and will error with `ObjectId() is not callable` or similar error.
You can kind of think of types as instantiated symbols, if that's helpful.
So: `ObjectId.toString() and ObjectId().fromString('x')` are both invalid, while
`ObjectId().toString() and ObjectId.fromString('x')` are both valid. 

## Templates
The symbol table includes an additional piece of metadata, called a `template`.
These are functions that accept strings and return strings, and are responsible for 
doing the string transformations from one language syntax to another language's syntax.
They are defined in `symbols/<ouput language>/templates.yaml`. This is where 
the majority of code generation happens, so the templates are **specific to the output language**.
Some templates take additional arguments, which are commented in symbols/sample_template.yaml.

Templates can be split into `template` and `argTemplate`. For symbols that are function 
calls, the `argsTemplate` is a function that gets applied to the arguments in case they 
need rearranging between languages.

## Project Structure
<img alt="indexjs" width="60%" align="right" src="/img-docs/indexjs.jpg"/>

Entry point to the project is `index.js`. It currently exports [two
APIs](https://github.com/mongodb-js/bson-transpilers#api), compiling a string
given `inputLang` and `outputLang`, and accessing language's import statements
you might need.

To construct a transpiler, `index.js` needs 4 components:
- `lib/antlr/<ANTLR tree visitor` The ANTLR-generated visitor for the generated parse tree.
- `codegeneration/CodeGenerationVisitor.js` The "generic" visitor for all input languages.
- `codegeneration/<input language>/Visitor.js` The visitor for the specific input language.
- `codegeneration/<ouput language>/Generator.js` - The generator for the specific output language.
- `lib/symbol-table/<input language>to<ouput language>.js` - The symbol table for 
the input+output combination.

#### TL;DR
- __CodeGenerationVisitor:__ place to store repeated code between all visitors.
- __Visitor:__ visits nodes; processes input language via
  `processs` methods and sends information to either output language's template found in the `Symbol
Template` or an `emit` method in the Generator`.
- __Generator:__ processes output language via `emit` methods, which take in tree nodes and return strings.
- __Symbol Table:__ a directory of the defined symbols, types and their metadata, including templates.
- __Symbol Template:__ does string manipulation to provide output.

The class hierarchy of any transpiler is
ANTLRVisitor <-- CodeGenerationVisitor <-- [input-language-specific] Visitor <-- [output-language-specific] Generator.

## A primer on the different types of methods
| Method name | Summary |
|--------------|-----------|
| `visit<*>` | Always auto-generated by ANTLR, overridden by language-specific visitors. Controls the flow of the tree visitation. |
| `get<*>` | Wrapper methods around nodes, defined by language-specific visitors. They exist because different grammars call equivalent nodes different names. |
| `generate<*>` | Shared logic between all input languages. Defined in `CodeGenerationVisitor` and called from language-specific visitor methods. |
| `return<*>` | Separates string generation from object generation. Defined in `CodeGenerationVisitor` or `object/Generator`. |
| `process<*>` | Special case for entire input language. Defined in visitors, called programmatically within the visitor. |
| `emit<*>` | Special case for entire output language. Defined in generators, called programmatically by the visitors. |

### Tests
Tests are written in YAML. Each yaml file requires two keys, first 'runner' which is a
function that runs each individual test. The function signature is always `(it, expect, input, output, transpiler, test)`
where `test` is a copy of a single YAML test. The second key is 'tests' which is an array
of individual tests. Each test has three fields, 'description' (string), 'input', and 'output'.
The 'input' and 'output' fields are objects with the fields as languages and the values as
the code to be either compiled or expected.

The test runner is test/run-yaml.test.js.
If it's not possible to run the tests you want to write using run-yaml.test.js,
you can add your YAML file to test/yaml/edge-cases and write your own runner.
Although I doubt that will end up being needed.

## Adding an Output Language

1. Create a directory in `symbols` directory for your output language:
```shell
mkdir symbols/<output lang>
```
2. Create a `templates.yaml` file to store your language's templates. Inside
   you'll probably want to copy the contents from the `symbols/sample_templates.yaml` file.
   That file also includes comments on which template functions require unusual arguments.
```shell
cp symbols/sample_template.yaml symbols/<output lang>/templates.yaml
```
3. Add your new language to the `compile-symbol-table.js` file:
```js
const outputLangs = ['java', 'shell', 'python', 'csharp', 'javascript', 'mylanguage'];
```
4. You should now run `npm run compile` to generate a complete symbol table.
   This will be generated in `lib/symbol-table/javascriptto<output lang>` and
`lib/symbol-table/shellto<output lang>`.
5. You will have to require the generated symbol tables in `index.js`:
```js
const javascript<output lang>symbols = require('lib/symbol-table/javascriptto<output lang>')
const get<output lang>Generator = require('./codegeneration/<output lang>/Generator.js');
// and then add another export to module.exports at the bottom of the file:

module.exports = {
  javascript: {
    <output lang>: getTranspiler(
     getJSTree,
     getJavascriptVisitor(getCodeGenerationVisitor(JavascriptANTLRVisitor)),
     get<output lang>Generator,
     javascript<output lang>symbols)
  }
  /* ... and every other language that can compile to your language. 
   * Make sure you update the getTree method, as well as the input-language
   * specific visitor and the ANTLR visitor to match the input lang. */
}
```
6. We still don't have a `Generator.js` file required above, so that won't
   quite work yet. So next, create a new directory in `codegeneration` for your
output language:
```shell
mkidr codegeneration/<output lang>
```
7. And create a generator file:
```shell
touch codegeneration/<output lang>/Generator.js
```
8. Most of the Generators are empty nowadays because the work has been moved into
the templates. I would expect that 90% of the time, what you're trying to do can
be done in the templates without changing the template signature. However, if you
really can't do it in the templates, you can copy any of the generators that exist
and fill in any emit methods you require. The class should be created with a super
class that is passed to the function, like so:
```js
/*
 * Class for handling edge cases for node code generation. Defines "emit" methods.
 */
module.exports = (Visitor) => class Generator extends Visitor {
  constructor() {
    super();
  }
  emitX(ctx) {
    ...
  }
};
`` 
```
9. Next thing is tests! You must go through each test file and add the results of
compiling each input into your output language under the `output` field. 
```yaml
    Document: 
    - input: 
          javascript: "{x: '1'}"
          shell: "{x: '1'}"
          python: "{'x': '1'}"
      output: 
          javascript: "{\n  'x': '1'\n}"
          python: "{\n    'x': '1'\n}"
          java: "eq(\"x\", \"1\")"
          csharp: "new BsonDocument(\"x\", \"1\")"
          shell: "{\n  'x': '1'\n}"
          <your output language>: ...
```
