# Combobox (Forked)

This is a fork of the [LeafyGreen Combobox](https://github.com/mongodb/leafygreen-ui/tree/main/packages/combobox) component, which adds additional feature - field descriptions.

Please note that this is intended as a temporary solution until the original LeafyGreen Combobox component supports this feature. Once it does, it is recommended to switch back to using the official version of the component.

### Note

This forked component is not covered by tests or linting. [COMPASS-6465](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/COMPASS-6465) tracks the removal of this fork.
