# Logo Icon

The Logo Icon represents the MongoDB Compass logo. It's commonly used in headers, navigation bars, or as a branding element throughout the application.

## Usage

```tsx
import { LogoIcon } from '@mongodb-js/compass-components';

function MyComponent() {
  return <LogoIcon />;
}
```

## Examples

### Default

<Story name="Default">{() => <LogoIcon />}</Story>

## Guidelines

- The icon is designed to be used at its original size (72x72 pixels)
- It automatically adapts to light/dark mode
- It's SVG-based for crisp rendering at any size
- It should be used primarily for branding and identification purposes
- It should maintain its aspect ratio when resized
- It should always be accompanied by text or a tooltip for screen readers
