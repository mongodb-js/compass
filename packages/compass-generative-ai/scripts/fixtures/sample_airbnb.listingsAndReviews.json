It's exactly same as the pictures, super clean, large enough for 1 or 2 person and you need only 3 mins walk from the Museum Station. It's also close to the mart, convenience store and easy to take a taxi. What I love the most is that it's just near the Hyde Park. It means that you could walk there every morning and night with beautiful view. And comfortable bed, clean and large shower booth, big screen TV with Samsung Smart-hub, big dinning table... everything in room was ready for your perfect trip. In addition, Desireé is really kind, good-hearted host. I couldn't meet her but she always answer kindly to my messages and give help everytime :D Don't miss this room!! "

The apartment was immaculate and really did provide a home away from home. You could seriously just turn up at his place as everything is provided for the guest's use. Desiree thought of all the little special touches - from fresh fruit and sparkling water to chocolates and flowers.  The location is fantastic - walking distance to all that Sydney has to offer.   Her guide book and restaurant recommendations were wonderful.  Highly recommended  - better than any hotel stay!  We  will be back again!  Many thanks Desiree"

Desireé was a wonderful host and had some lovely touches such as stocking the fridge with beers and provided snacks, fruit and milk etc. the bathroom was also stocked with products and didn't even need to use my own shampoo etc. We also were allowed an early check in and a late check out which was just amazing.

She was wonderfully generous with items left in the fridge for me to help myself to, and even some lovely fresh flowers for me on arrival. It's a gorgeous apartment right in the hub of the city BUT with the bedroom double glazed I had some of the best nights sleeps here I've had in ages. Terrific stay. Best part? Uber wide screen Tv and free NETFLIX! I loved this apartment. Don't hesitate to book."

The hotel rooms get marked down for being dated in reviews on hotel sites, but this apartment certainly isn't.  It's centrally located: it has Darlinghurst's little strip of restaurants just around the corner, and central Sydney equally close in the other direction.  I was here for a week in March and it (unusually) rained every day, so the 60\" UHD Samsung smart TV with Netflix and Stan (Aussie streaming), as well as Apple TV, was particularly welcome, as was the small gym on the roof.  The pool was less useful, but would be great normally.  Desireé is a very friendly host too.  Highly recommended."

It hosts beautiful city views, a quick 5 minute walk to Museum rail station, and a hop to great restaurants and nightlife. The apartment is tastefully decorated with art and books from adventurous travels; furnished and accessorized with absolutely everything that I could require, plus more. I was impressed at the Desireé's thoughtfulness in accommodating her guests needs. Such things as a kind welcome note. Petite chocolates, mini fresh milk packs in the fridge, expresso machine and every conceivable toiletry item one could need inside a bathroom cabinet. Discreetly rolled up extension cords so you never have to look for one to reach the wall socket to charge your digital devices. The bed was comfortable, where sprigs of fragrant lavender greeted us laid upon freshly rolled up towels. We loved our stay and highly recommend Desireé as a host. She communicated well, was always polite and prompt with messaging all required information upon booking. There's no doubt why Desireé has been voted as a super host. You will be delighted."

There is a guest laundry in the building with coin operated machines and you can do a big wash and dry for $4 each.  The apartment is bright and airy and has a nice busy city outlook which we enjoyed.  You can certainly hear the buzz of the city around you but you are right in the CBD so that is to be expected and enjoyed.  The location is fantastic.  You can walk to just about everything in the city centre and trains and buses are only metres away if you want to get around more quickly or go further afield.  Very easy access from the airport by train into Museum station. The host, Desiree, was a pleasure to deal with, excellent communication all the way through.  This is a wonderful little home away from home putting you right into centre of the Sydney action."

We use Airbnb quite a bit and especially enjoy being able to have a kitchen area for a quick breakfast or meal and morning coffee. The unit was close to grocery, public transport and amenities were as if I had lived there. We were there to celebrate my spouse's 50th birthday and were pleasantly surprised by the nice and thoughtful birthday card. Thank you again and we had a blast!"

You are also on subway routes too!\n\nThe home is quiet even though the street and park are well used.  It feels super safe to walk in.\n\nThere are great grocery and restaurant options right here...and we were hooked on Greenhouse Coffee just a few blocks down to start our day. We enjoyed the Sydney Festival and walked to their events and free activities. \n\nThe home had lots of lovely touches and thoughtful additions in the bath, the kitchen and a nice collection of books and info."

This home and its location were perfect for our 6 night stay.  Would happily return on our next trip to Sydney."

Even though we booked our room through Airbnb, we were welcome to all the amenities the hotel had to offer.  We were pleased from our arrival at the hotel, where the exterior was as pretty as the interior and greeted by Robert whose very pleasant demeanor was refreshing.  Each of the staff at the hotel were very professional and accommodating but Robert stood out from the rest.  I was unfortunate enough to have left my phone at a nearby shop after returning via the hotel shuttle, when notifying the front desk to see if I had left my phone in the back seat, Robert quickly responded with his assistance in searching for the item, then driving us immediately to the last location while he assured us he would be outside waiting so we would not have to walk back. I did in fact find my phone at that location (thanks to a good Samaritan) and Robert refused to take compensation for his kindness.  The only thing I would do differently on our next stay is to spend the extra for the room with the patio, as the view from the hotel is quite nice and the breezes up there were wonderful.  We not only will be back to visit the lovely hotel but will gladly recommend it to all who might be vising the Greenpoint area. "

Indeed, because of a flight schedule change, I asked the Airbnb host and the welcome desk of the hotel how I could manage my last night cancellation to be refund. I did exactly what they asked me to do and have been informed two days after that they refused my request of refunding... Despite the policy rules, I found it very dishonest and not correct at all as I have asked them before doing the cancellation on Airbnb and the flight confirmation.\nMoreover, I felt insulted when they made me left the welcome desk to go to the basement in order to let other clients of the hotel believe everything is perfect (I was calm and just trying to solve the issue).\nSo to conclude, the room ok but bad experience in this Airbnb that is an hotel!"

Mia moglie, io e i tre bambini non abbiamo potuto fermarci neanche un minuto per le pessime condizioni in cui abbiamo trovato l'appartamento. Non corrisponde alle foto, perchè le stanze da letto sono molto più piccole di quello che appaiono, piene di suppellettili polverose e in disordine. Il sofa bed è praticamente un divano sporco dove abbiamo dovuto chiedere lenzuola e ci è stato dato un solo lenzuolo. Il bagno è una latrina minuscola tanto è vero che non appare nelle foto pubblicate. Non abbiamo potuto dormire neanche una notte perché non c'è neanche un cassetto o un armadio vuoto in cui poter stipare i propri effetti. Abbiamo pagato per tre notti oltre 800 euro, non abbiamo passato neanche venti minuti in quella casa, abbiamo dovuto trovare all'1 di notte un'altra sistemazione a New YorK - per cinque persone, compresi due bambini minori - e Chelsea non ci ha risarcito neanche un euro. Veramente un comportamento deprecabile da parte sua."

Bathroom was very dirty with a broken toilet seat that was never fixed ...eventhough the staff was politely reminded each of the seven nights we stayed...holiday or no holiday...how can you be running a place like that? AC wasnt functioning, however, it was fixed by the end of second night and a fan provided as a replacement. In the end, it was exceptional as a budget place. I would highly suggest that the management take cleaning and basic hygeine into serious consideration (mold on the bathroom wall) the place could earn a 4 star experience with ease. "

Since I was traveling alone, I was given a room enough for a single traveler. The room in the listing is probably the room beside mine. Anyway it is not a big deal. I would still definitely stay here in the future. Thanks Mehmet!"

The place is also in a restorant and bar zone, actually it is above a restorant, which is good because you have food and drink at hand, but it can be a little noisy at night. Mehmet was a great host, he's very friendly and accesible as well as the people at the restaurant below. 100% recomendable."

I went with my boyfriend who had been to the city before, and my first visit was fantastic in the area of Mehmit's place. Can walk to everything. Good food and drinks right downstairs, and staff and friends of the Siva Restaurant are always available.  It's very lively at night, so it's a great place to stay if you're social and stay up late.  Mehmit's place is the whole package and experience.  Well worth it and a good price."

He was also very responsive to additional questions. The residence service at the counter was also good and the blokes were helpful. The apartment is clean and spacious, although it could do with a couple of extra basic necessities particularly in the kitchen. \r\n\r\nHowever, two main things made this experience rather average instead of great.\r\n- I reserved a flat with TWO bedrooms and only got one. I complained and they relocated me to a bigger apartment with two separate beds, but still ONE bedroom.  Upon booking make sure to confirm its two bedrooms you sign up to.\r\n\r\n- Saturday seemed to be national construction day which meant 8am rise and shine. sunday there was activity too although less loud. Normally not a problem but not great when you experienced some of the Istanbul night life the night before. A notice about this at least would have been great."

The flat is light and spacious, kitchen well-equipped, bed comfortable (both beds actually), and bathroom clean, with great shower pressure. Zeynep prepared a note with key information about the flat, which was great to have for reference. I especially appreciated the ground coffee and coffee maker. The fact that there was a desk in the house made my stay all the more comfortable - I had a proper place to sit down at my computer.\r\n\r\nIt's clear that Zeynep has put a lot of care into making her flat a home - it's an awesome flat! \r\n\r\nZeynep lives a five min walk to the sea, with a great park along the water front. There are plenty of hip cafes and coffee shops in the neighborhood (Moda), all a short walk from the flat. And it's only a 15 mins walk to the Kadikoy ferry, which offers easy access to the rest of Istanbul."

It was an easy 3 minute walk and be on your way to anywhere in NY. \r\nThe shower is something else, the best water pressure I have experienced in a long time.\r\nI thought the decor was cool and eclectic, Greta must have an artistic streak. The Murphy bed was comfortable, and the AC unit (not pictured) kept it nice and cool.  \r\nAlthough I didn't meet her, she arranged for a neighbor to meet me and show me in. He was cool and so were any other neighbors that I met. \r\nShe also left a list of suggestions where to shop and eat, along with menus which was helpful when I needed a late night meal. \r\nHighly recommended. \r\n"

Being from Hawaii, we had no knowledge about radiators and how to use them - we really appreciated her thoughtfulness!"

The bed is surprisingly comfy and firm (I have never slept in a Murphy bed before) and the shower had plenty of hot water and great pressure. Greta was very communicative and friendly, and was also incredibly accommodating when I had something come up unexpectedly and needed to stay a couple hours longer than I anticipated. Overall all it was a very cozy stay in a great location!"

I would describe the apartment as a very warm, personal, comfortable and homey place to stay. It’s a corner apartment with good light, lots of books and  very good energy. Plus, the beds are quite comfortable. My daughter exclaimed “Hey Dad, come lie down in this one. You’ll never want to get up!”\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood was incredibly well located and enjoyable. The train stops  a half block away, and there are numerous excellent restaurants and conveniences close by. Greta, the host, provides a first-rate list of recommendations.\r\n\r\nGreta was a personable, helpful and extremely welcoming host. She was very quick to respond to my online inquiries and, once we arrived, to any further requests for advice.\r\n"

We were two of us and only used one room, but the house can fit another person or two. \r\nFor anyone visiting NYC and looking to be in the city but not in the midst of the city noise, this is a great place to stay!

The Murphy (fold-down) bed has a very thick memory foam mattress that is extremely comfortable.  Samantha (the cat) was a sweet little presence, but she kept mostly to herself so we barely saw her.  The location is great, less than a block to the 1 line, and there are several nice restaurants in the neighborhood.  Finally, Greta herself was a perfect host:  kind but not intrusive, thoughtful in her preparations for guests, and available should any problems arise (though none did).  A great airbnb experience!"

I requested her a really early check in and she agreed (which was helpful because I took a red eye from Seattle). She also allowed me to keep my bags after my check out time so I could pick it up before my flight.\r\nSecond - her apartment location is SUPER convenient. Right next to the #1 and pretty close to B and C lines. NYC is all about location is this fits perfectly.\r\nThird - her apartment gives the feel of a typical NYC apartment. It is tiny but has everything you need. Two beds, a great shower, clean towels, and a kitchen (which I didn't use). Safe building with elevator. \r\n\r\nI would totally stay here again.  "

Her apt is located close to all amenities, Central and Riverside Parks, and bus/subway stops. The apt is clean, more spacious than expected, well stocked with anything you could possibly need, and has very comfortable beds and a first rate shower. I was travelling with my soon-to-be 17 year old daughter so she was thrilled to have her own bedroom! This is not fancy accommodation but warm and homey and probably a good representation of how an average New Yorker lives, although I suspect not many are as organized as Greta. Much recommended!"

Greta always replied immediately in the outmost helpful way during preparation and stay. thank you Greta! we will hopefully be back soon :)\n"

The subway entrance close to the apartment was manned and easy to buy and top up your pass, it is the only way to travel around the city. On leaving for the airport, after both our stays we had only to wait a minute on the corner with our luggage to get a taxi to the airport. Once again Greta allowed us to arrive and leave at times that suited us with our luggage which didn't leave us stranded for hours with difficult flight times from Australia which was a great relief, thanks so much Greta!"

We took Lyft around due to my mom's use of a wheelchair in the streets. Drivers made good time to and from lower Manhattan via larger roads. Elevator made it easy to get to and from the 4th floor apartment, and being on the 4th floor removed us from the street a bit. "

However, the location itself appeared to be great: the neighborhood around was magnificent, a very vibrant area, with extremely cheap and nice restaurants, street food vendors, shops etc everywhere. And actually, not touristic at all, you are going to see how local people live around there. Especially Mong Kok, which is just a little bit south, I really enjoyed walking around in the evenings. There are plenty of bus stops around, and the subway is at most 5 minutes away.\n\nThe place was also very nice. It was nice to see how common houses there look like and live there. Do not expect high luxuries or something, it is just a normal house. For me, it was a very nice place and adequately clean. There is also kitchen but I did not use it; there is tons of great and cheap food around, so there was no reason to spend time cooking (but Vicky one cooked and shared)! In general, I did not experience any negative issue regarding the facilities of the house.\n\nVicky provides with a sim card with unlimited internet, so it is even better than just having wifi in the house, as you can have internet in your smartphone or laptop everywhere you go. This helped navigating around the city a lot.\n\nVicky and her flatmate, J., were really nice and friendly. Initially, Vicky gave exact and clear instructions on how to get there. Both gave quite many suggestions on what to do in the city, and I even spent time with them. Both seem very interested in interacting with the guests, as long as they have time, of course. \n\nOverall, I am really enjoyed my stay there. I enjoyed being in that location and walking around. Everything concerning the house was working fine, making my stay in Hong Kong comfortable. Also I am very happy to have met Vicky and J., and enjoyed our interactions. I would certainly recommend."

She also let me check-in earlier than the listed time since my flight arrived early.\n\nAs for the place, what you get is a simple, cozy room that’s perfect for solo travelers. It is spacious enough to have room for luggage and there is a desk where I was able to comfortably work. The room has very good air conditioning that keeps the room cool despite the hot and humid weather in Hong Kong.\n\nIt is very close to MTR and bus stations so it’s easy to get around if you feel like exploring. There are also shops and convenience stores nearby if you ever decide to grab a quick snack.\n\nI had a very pleasant stay at Yi’s place during the 3 nights I spent in Hong Kong."

I was not able to sleep when I was there because it was cold, and the bed blanket was very thin.  I could also hear everything going on in the living room . The neighborhood was depressing. Several people warned me about walking alone in the area late at night. I ended up spending a lot of time and money looking for an alternative place after I arrived in Hong Kong. It was close to New Year's Eve, so I had to return to this place for the last nights of my stay as I could not find an affordable hotel room. I cannot recommend this place."

          "comments": "First the good things\n The location is very very central, it is very safe, and the doorman is great\n There is a laundry in the building on the entrance floor and it automatically  includes soap. The apartment is very quiet for the area. Although I never met Yi in person she was always accessible to communicate. The room was very sparse but functional wifi was good.\n\nThe place has 3 bedrooms, a common living room with a table, a Chinese style kitchen and a very tiny showering area with hot water which is typical of Hong Kong apartments. There is a functional  TV. The price  is fantastic, cannot be matched.\n\nNow the not so good. The place is the most dirty place I have ever stayed at in HK, and at one point I lived for many years in HK. Yi mentioned the cleaning fee was for the bedrooms only and also no towel is included, which I believe she listed but I did not notice.  The place is good for backpackers and undergraduates. The entire week I was there 4 to 5 men and women stayed there and I can state the bathroom was never cleaned. The kitchen looks like a tornado hit it, and some of the grime is that thick amber tacky stuff from years of grease buildup. The living room is a thick dusty mess, the sheet covering the couch reeks. I had no idea someone, an airline stewardess who I never saw, had her personal things there and in fact the apartment was her home.  I borrowed a mirror left out on the table, and ate some crackers that I mistakenly thought were left by previous guests and it caused huge problems but I immediately returned the mirror and replaced the crackers.\n\nAll in all a mixed experience. I am sure others saw what I saw, but did not mention the messy aspect in their reviews. I am not being picky, but I wish I had know before I booked what I would actually encounter.\n\n Still it is a good deal, best walked into with your eyes wide open and a high tolerance for filthy common areas."

Location is very close to Prince Edward Station (exit A; Tsuen Wan Line) and Shek Kip Mei Station (exit A; Kwun Tong Line) so it's very convenient. There are supermarkets, bakeries, and local eateries around the area.  Laundry facilities are located within the building. There is a lift to the apartment, which is a relief for travelers with heavy luggage. Inside the apartment, there's a kitchenette, which is good for getting hot or boiled water. Wifi connection is strong within apartment. Inside the bathroom, a shower curtain separates the shower and toilet areas. Hence, some people might feel cramped while showering. The room that I booked has windows and is equipped with strong aircon. Overall, I enjoyed my stay in this apartment. This is a very good area to experience local Hong Kong life where one can see elderly folks, mummies with children, blue collar workers, and of course office workers mingling with each other. Though this area in Sham Shui Po is not posh, its down to earth vibes makes this place very real. "
