        NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription
        
        This key is required by macOS to explain why the application needs access to the local network.
        The message is displayed to users when macOS requests permission for local network access.
        
        This permission is triggered when MongoDB Compass performs DNS operations (via os-dns-native)
        to resolve MongoDB connection strings, particularly for mongodb+srv:// URIs that require SRV record lookups.
        
        See: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nslocalnetworkusagedescription
