Components from this plugin can be interracted with using
[hadron-app][hadron-app] and [hadron-app-registry][hadron-app-registry]. Here are
a few examples of working with `compass-crud`'s `Action` and `Roles`.

Render an editable document in a React component.
```jsx
const app = require('hadron-app');
const React = require('react');

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.Document = app.appRegistry.getRole('CRUD.Document')[0].component;
  }
  render() {
    return (<this.Document doc={this.props.document} editable />);
  }
}
```

Render a non-editable pre-expanded document in a React component.
```jsx
const app = require('hadron-app');
const React = require('react');

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.Document = app.appRegistry.getRole('CRUD.Document')[0].component;
  }
  render() {
    return (<this.Document doc={this.props.document} expandAll />);
  }
}
```

Listen to the various CRUD actions.

```javascript
const app = require('hadron-app');
const CrudActions = app.appRegistry.getAction('CRUD.Actions');

CrudActions.documentRemoved.listen((id) => {
  console.log(`Document with _id ${id} removed.`);
});

CrudActions.openInsertDocumentDialog((doc, clone) => {
  if (clone) {
    console.log('Opening insert dialog with cloned document');
  }
});

CrudActions.insertDocument((doc) => {
  console.log('Inserting document into db');
});
```

### App Registry Events Emmitted
Various actions within this plugin will emit events for other parts of the
application can be listened to via [hadron-app-registry][hadron-app-registry].
`Local` events are scoped to a `Tab`.
`Global` events are scoped to the whole Compass application.

#### Global
- **'document-view-changed', view**: indicates document view changed. `view` can
  be either `JSON`, `List`, or `Table`.
- **'documents-paginated'**: indicates when pagination is complete. Called when
  calling the next or previous pages in pagination.
- **'documents-refreshed'**: indicates documents were refreshed.
- **'document-inserted'**: indicates documents were inserted. Called when
  `insertMany` and `insertOne` complete.
- **'document-updated'**: indicates a document was updated.
- **'document-deleted'**: indicates a document was deleted.

#### Local

- **'refresh-data'**: received when other plugins need documents refreshed.
  Refreshes documents.
  (reloaded). Refreshes instance state: `dataLake` variables.

## Development
### Code Tour
`Compass Crud` uses React, and Reflux for state management. There are two stores
we manage: `crud-store`(`./src/stores/crud-store.js`) and
`grid-store`(`./src/stores/grid-store.js`). Overall structure of this repo:

- `./config`: webpack configurations for dev, prod, and testing
- `./electron`: electron setup to run this plugin locally.
- `./lib`: webpack-compiled version of this plugin.
- `./scripts`: scripts to `link` and `unlink` React version to compass when
  developing this locally in Compass.
- `./src/actions`: reflux actions that are available throughout this plugin.
- `./src/assets`: css assets, such as variables and styles from compass.
- `./src/components`: react components that make up this plugin. Almost all
  components have a `.jsx`, `.spec.js`, `.less` and `.js` files.
- `./src/stores`: home to reflux stores.
- `./src/utils`: util `.js` files to be used throughout the plugin.

### Running locally
`./electron` directory contains an Electron instance that allows for this plugin
to be developed in isolation from other Compass plugins. By default it sets up a
MongoDB connection to `echo` database and `artists` collection. To get it to
work with a db and collection of your choice, change [db variable
here][db-variable] and [collection variable here][coll-variable].
