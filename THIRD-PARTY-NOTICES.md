         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct

                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,

                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not

                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution

                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability

            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct

                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of

                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and

            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,

            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct

                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of

                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and

            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,

            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable

            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications

            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable

            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed

                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but

            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not

                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,

                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct

                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not

                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each

            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct

                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,

                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications

            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses

                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of

                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or

            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct

                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,

                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and

            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with

            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,

            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable

            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,

                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,

            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications

            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable

            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct

                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,

            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or

            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,

            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications

            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable

            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)

            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained

                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions

            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"

            the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
            comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
            file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
            same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
            identification within third-party archives.

            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable

            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained

                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed

                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason

            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or

            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable

            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without

            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct

                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,

                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions

            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify

            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,

            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
            replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
            the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
            comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
            file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
            same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
            identification within third-party archives.

            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
            replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
            the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
            comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
            file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
            same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
            identification within third-party archives.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
      Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
      stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
      that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
      attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
      excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
      the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
      distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
      include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
      within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
      pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
      of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
      as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
      documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
      within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
      wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
      of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
      do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
      notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
      or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
      that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
      as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
            replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
            the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
            comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
            file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
            same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
            identification within third-party archives.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
            replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
            the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
            comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
            file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
            same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
            identification within third-party archives.

            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
            replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
            the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
            comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
            file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
            same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
            identification within third-party archives.

          ownership of such entity.

          "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation
          or translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled
          object code, generated documentation, and conversions to

          "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object
          form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice
          that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the
          Appendix below).

          "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form,
          that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial
          revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent,
          as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this
          License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable
          from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and
          Derivative Works thereof.

          "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original
          version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or
          Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for
          inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or
          Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner.
          For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of
          electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its
          representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic
          mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems
          that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of
          discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is
          conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright
          owner as "Not a Contribution."

          "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on
          behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
          subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License.

          Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor
          hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
          royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare
          Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense,
          and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in
          Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License.

          Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor
          hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
          royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent
          license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and
          otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those
          patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily
          infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
          Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.
          If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
          cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a
          Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or
          contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to
          You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such
          litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution.

          You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works
          thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or
          Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

          1. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a
          copy of this License; and

          2. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating
          that You changed the files; and

          3. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
          distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from
          the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain
          to any part of the Derivative Works; and

          4. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution,
          then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy
          of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding
          those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works,
          in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file
          distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a
          display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such
          third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are
          for informational purposes only and do not modify the License.
          You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You
          distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,
          provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

          You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
          provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
          reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
          Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
          distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions
          stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions.

          Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally
          submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under
          the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional
          terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall
          supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may
          have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks.

          This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
          service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for
          reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
          reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

          Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor
          provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions)
          on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
          either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties
          or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS
          FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
          appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
          associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability.

          In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort
          (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
          applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed
          to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages,
          including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential
          damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of
          the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages
          for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction,
          or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such
          Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

          While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
          to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
          indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with
          this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
          on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any
          other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold
          each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims
          asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such
          warranty or additional liability.

      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work

          To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following boilerplate
          notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]" replaced with your own
          identifying information. (Don't include the brackets!) The text should be
          enclosed in the appropriate comment syntax for the file format. We also
          recommend that a file or class name and description of purpose be included
          on the same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
          identification within third-party archives.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to

            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications

            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable

            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
            replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
            the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
            comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
            file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
            same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
            identification within third-party archives.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct

                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of

                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,

            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor

      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner

      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
      Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
      stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
      that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
      attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
      excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
      the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
      distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
      include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
      within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
      pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
      of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
      as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
      documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
      within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
      wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
      of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
      do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
      notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
      or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
      that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
      as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
      Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
      stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
      that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
      attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
      excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
      the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
      distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
      include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
      within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
      pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
      of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
      as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
      documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
      within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
      wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
      of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
      do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
      notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
      or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
      that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
      as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
            replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
            the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
            comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
            file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
            same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
            identification within third-party archives.

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

      >

      > 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

      >

      > 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
      Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
      stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
      that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
      attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
      excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
      the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
      distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
      include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
      within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
      pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
      of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
      as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
      documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
      within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
      wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
      of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
      do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
      notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
      or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
      that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
      as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      Copyright 2010-2019 Adobe (http://www.adobe.com/), with Reserved Font Name 'Source'. All Rights Reserved. Source is a trademark of Adobe in the United States and/or other countries.



      This Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.



      This license is copied below, and is also available with a FAQ at: http://scripts.sil.org/OFL





      -----------------------------------------------------------

      SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007

      -----------------------------------------------------------



      PREAMBLE

      The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide

      development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation

      efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and

      open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership

      with others.



      The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and

      redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The

      fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,

      redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved

      names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,

      however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The

      requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply

      to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.



      DEFINITIONS

      "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright

      Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may

      include source files, build scripts and documentation.



      "Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the

      copyright statement(s).



      "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as

      distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).



      "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,

      or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the

      Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a

      new environment.



      "Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical

      writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.



      PERMISSION & CONDITIONS

      Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining

      a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,

      redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font

      Software, subject to the following conditions:



      1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,

      in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.



      2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,

      redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy

      contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be

      included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or

      in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or

      binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.



      3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font

      Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding

      Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as

      presented to the users.



      4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font

      Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any

      Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the

      Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written

      permission.



      5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,

      must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be

      distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to

      remain under this license does not apply to any document created

      using the Font Software.



      TERMINATION

      This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are

      not met.



      DISCLAIMER

      THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,

      EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF

      MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT

      OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE

      COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY,

      OTHER DEALINGS IN THE FONT SOFTWARE.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

      You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

      You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

      If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
            replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
            the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
            comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
            file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
            same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
            identification within third-party archives.
