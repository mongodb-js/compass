# Hypotheses

## Gain Creators

- We believe the most important job for #{TargetCustomer} is to explore the schema.
- We believe the second most important job for #{TargetCustomer} is to share the details of their schema exploration within their organization.
- We believe the third most important job for #{TargetCustomer} is to design new schemas.
- We believe enabling #{TargetCustomer}'s to view how a schema changes over time is sorely missing.
- We believe enabling #{TargetCustomer}'s to add descriptions to fields within the schema will be a pain reliever.

## Customer Survey Dec 2014 Exploration and Analysis

- We believe that feature requests for #{TargetCustomer} a data-viewer/data-browser/query-builder are imperfect information.
- We believe that when #{TargetCustomer}s request a data-viewer/data-browser/query-builder it is view the schema.
- We believe #{TargetCustomer} does not want a "TOAD for MongoDB".
- We believe #{TargetCustomer} does not want a standard QT/Win32/Swing application.
- We believe #{TargetCustomer}'s who say they prefer applications delivered via the browser might mean they actually prefer polished and performant experiences they can only compare to web-based applications.
- We believe #{TargetCustomer}'s want us to instruct them on proper index usage.
- We believe #{TargetCustomer}'s want us to instruct them on proper sharding configuration.

## Positioning

- We do not believe Scout is an enterprise-only feature.
- We believe Scout will provide insight into MongoDB's market penetration that will be a critical factor to the success of MongoDB Inc.
- We believe Scout will provide insight into MongoDB feature usage that will be a critical factor to the success of MongoDB Inc.
- We believe Scout will provide a channel for MongoDB Inc. to communicate with those that do not want to sign-up for our newsletters.
- We believe Scout will provide a channel for MongoDB Inc. that will substantially reduce support costs.
- We believe Scout will provide a channel for MongoDB Inc. that will substantially improve the support experience.
- We believe Scout will allow MongoDB University to source more qualified sales leads.
- We believe Scout will allow MongoDB Cloud to source more qualified sales leads.
- We believe Scout will fill a critical gap in our sales cycle, between the millions of anonymous downloaders and the premium offerings of  MongoDB Inc.
- We do not believe Scout alone will convert existing users into paying MongoDB Enterprise customers.

## PHPMyAdmin (CRUD Admin Tool)

- We believe there is sufficient demand for investigating a "PHPMyAdmin for MongoDB" Value Proposition (e.g. automatic django admin).

## Real-time

- We believe there is sufficient demand for investigating a "real-time" value proposition (e.g. visualizing data from the query profiler, visualizing db.serverStats() data).
- We believe the core technologies used in Scout could be delivered as a new agent managed by automation that would enable real-time, bi-directional interaction from the MongoDB Cloud web application to any MongoDB deployment managed by MongoDB Cloud.

## Platform Support

- We believe we should support Windows as our primary deployment environment.
- We believe we should support OSX as our secondary deployment platform.
- We do not believe we should support Linux as a deployment platform.
- We do not believe we should support MongoDB prior to 2.6.x.
- We do not believe we should support Windows versions prior to Windows 7.

## Web Shell (electron)

- We believe using a web-based application shell will cut down development compared to fully native desktop applications.
- We believe using a web-based application shell will allow us to iterate faster in the market compared to fully native desktop application.
- We believe using a web-based application shell will allow us to get to market faster compared to fully a native desktop application.
- We believe electron is sufficiently performant.
- We believe electron is mature enough as a project.
- We believe electron is a sound investment.

## Shape of Data in the Wild

- We believe most collections contain documents with missing fields.
- We believe most collections contain subdocuments with a nesting depth < 5.
- We believe sampling will start displaying schema information within 1000ms for any collection size under no load.
- We believe sampling does not impact overall cpu/concurrency on a deployment under high load.

## Authentication

- We believe most deployments use CR, SCRAM, or no authentication.

## Querying for Documents

- We believe #{TargetUser}'s want to inspect the full contents of a single document when debugging application issues.
- We believe #{TargetUser}'s want to inspect the full contents of a single document when demoing features of their application.
- We believe #{TargetUser}'s primarily want to learn the how to apply the query language, not the query language itself.
- We believe #{TargetCustomer} wants to refine the set of documents being observed.
- We believe that refining a set a documents being observed is substantially distinct from query composition.

## OTHER

- We believe Scout should help #{TargetCustomer}'s solve problems, but not do it automatically.
