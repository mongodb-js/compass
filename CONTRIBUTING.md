# Contributing

## Workflow

MongoDB welcomes community contributions! If youâ€™re interested in making a contribution to MongoDB Compass, please follow the steps below before you start writing any code:

1. Sign the [contributor's agreement](http://www.mongodb.com/contributor). This will allow us to review and accept contributions.
1. Fork the repository on GitHub
1. Create a branch with a name that briefly describes your feature
1. Implement your feature or bug fix
1. Add new cases to `./tests` that verify your bug fix or make sure no one
   unintentionally breaks your feature in the future and run them with `npm test`
1. Add comments around your new code that explain what's happening
1. Commit and push your changes to your branch then submit a pull request

## Bugs

You can report new bugs by
[creating a new issue](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/COMPASS/).
Please include as much information as possible about your environment.
