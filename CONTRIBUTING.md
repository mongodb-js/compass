# Contributing

Great to have you here. These are a few ways you can help make this project better:

- scratch an itch and implement a new feature using our [workflow](#workflow)
- add an example to README.md
- avoid sending pull requests related to "style" or whitespace as we have
  tools in our workflow to do this already
- [create a new issue](http://github.com/10gen/scout/issues)
  if there is something you need this project to do that it currently doesn't.
  We're always more than happy to chat about other projects.

More information to help you work on Scout is available in
[the dev guide](https://github.com/10gen/scout/blob/dev/docs/dev.md).

## Workflow

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
1. Create a branch with a name that briefly describes your feature
1. Implement your feature or bug fix
1. Add new cases to `./tests.js` that verify your bug fix or make sure no one
   unintentionally breaks your feature in the future and run them with `npm test`
1. Add comments around your new code that explain what's happening
1. @todo: Run `npm run-script check` to tidy up your code and show you where you
   might want to change things to be safer or easier to use
1. Commit and push your changes to your branch then submit a pull request

Donâ€™t get discouraged! We estimate that the response time from the
maintainers is less than 24 hours.

## Bugs

It would be extremely helpful, if you have the time, to
look at existing bugs and help us understand if:

* The bug is reproducible?
* Is it reproducible in other environments (browsers)?
* If they weren't included originally, what are the steps to reproduce?

You can report new bugs by
[creating a new issue](http://github.com/10gen/scout/issues).
Please include as much information as possible about your environment
("I am using node.js v 0.10.28 on OSX Mavericks").  Actual code is always
more valuable than an explanation, so please include a link to a GitHub
gist or include a snippet directly in your issue description.

## Versioning

This library aims to adhere to [Semantic Versioning2.0.0](http://semver.org/).
Violations of this scheme should be reported as bugs. Specifically, if a
minor or patch version is released that breaks backward compatibility,
that version should be immediately yanked and/or a new version should be
immediately released that restores compatibility.
