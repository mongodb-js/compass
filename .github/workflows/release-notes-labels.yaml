# Prepare and validate a PR for auto-generated release notes:
# - if the title starts with `feat` or `fix` adds the label (`feat`, `fix`) used
#   by the release notes to include the PR in the appropriate section.
# - each PR that is a `feat` or `fix` must also include either a
#   `feature flagged` or `release notes` label, PRs that have the `feature flagged`
#   label will not be included in the release notes.
