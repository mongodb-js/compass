## Performance Red Flags

## Code Quality Essentials

- Functions should be focused and appropriately sized
- Use clear, descriptive naming conventions
- Ensure proper error handling throughout
- Suggest changes to improve code readability and maintainability

## Best practices

- Refer to official documentation and best practices for React.js, Redux and Node.js. If you see anti-patterns, highlight them and provide references to the relevant documentation.

## Review Style

- Be specific and actionable in feedback
- Explain the "why" behind recommendations

## MongoDB Specifics
