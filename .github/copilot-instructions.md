For overview, do not summarize the changes. Only provide high level feedback on code quality, performance, and best practices.

When reviewing code, focus on:

## Performance Red Flags

- Spot inefficient loops and algorithmic issues
- Check for memory leaks and resource cleanup

## Code Quality Essentials

- Functions should be focused and appropriately sized
- Use clear, descriptive naming conventions
- Ensure proper error handling throughout
- Suggest changes to improve code readability and maintainability

## Best practices

- Refer to official documentation and best practices for React.js, Redux and Node.js. If you see anti-patterns, highlight them and provide links to the relevant official documentation.

## Review Style

- Be specific and actionable in feedback
- Explain the "why" behind recommendations

## MongoDB Specifics

### Performance antipatterns

- Warn about db.stats() performance implications, especially in connection with freeStorage: 1. Provide a reference to the official MongoDB documentation.
