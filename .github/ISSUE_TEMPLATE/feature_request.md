**We are currently not using github issues to track feature requests.**

We track feature requests in our feedback forum:
https://feedback.mongodb.com/forums/924283-compass

Please submit feature requests and ideas there. The feedback forum enables other people to vote on ideas so we can get a better sense of how many folks are interested in a change. You can also receive  updates when certain features and requests are implemented.

We're working on making Compass better and are interested to hear your ideas and thoughts!

Please submit bug reports and issues through our public jira project:
