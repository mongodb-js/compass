# This evergreen .yml is intentionally left empty.
# We want the compass-generative-ai-accuracy evergreen project to run
# daily on the latest commit. This file is here so that we have a
# .yml config to point the evergreen project to so that
# it can uses the most recent commits when the daily run happens.

# The .yml that runs those tests is `generative-ai-accuracy-test.yml`.
# We don't want it to run on every commit as that would be too many
# requests to our ai model (expensive).
