<strong>
Provide certificate(s) of one or more Certificate Authorities that you trust
to validate the server's identity.
</strong>

For production use, your MongoDB deployment should use valid certificates
generated and signed by a single certificate authority. You or your organization
can generate and maintain an independent certificate authority, or use
certificates generated by a third-party SSL vendor.

To verify the identity of the MongoDB deployment you connect to, provide
one or more certificates of trusted Certificate Authorities. If this field
is left blank, the server's identity will not be checked which is
**not recommended** because it leaves you vulnerable to man-in-the-middle
attacks.
