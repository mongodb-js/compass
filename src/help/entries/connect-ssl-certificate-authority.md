<strong>
Provide certificate(s) of one or more Certificate Authorities that you trust
to validate the server's identity.
</strong>

For production use, your MongoDB deployment should use valid certificates
generated and signed by a single certificate authority. You or your organization
can generate and maintain an independent certificate authority, or use
certificates generated by a third-party SSL vendor.

To verify the identity of the MongoDB deployment you connect to, provide
one or more certificates of trusted Certificate Authorities.
