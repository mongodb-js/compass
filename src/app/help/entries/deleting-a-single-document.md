A single document can be deleted by clicking on the delete icon
<i class='fa fa-trash-o' aria-hidden='true'></i> on the right
side of the document in the document list. Clicking on this button puts
the document into a pending delete mode, but the delete command will
not be sent to the server until the user confirms the edits by clicking 'Delete'.
